## Description

![I2C-HAT picture]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/i2c-hat-marked.jpg "I2C-HAT")

The `I2C-HAT` is a type of Raspberry Pi add-on board that uses the I2C bus for communication. The communication protocol is a request/response type protocol, Raspberry Pi issues a request an gets a response back from the `I2C-HAT`, usually this takes about 2ms, depends on what was the `I2C-HAT` was requested to do.

The `I2C-HAT` draws power from the +5V supply rail. If you plan to stack multiple `I2C-HATs` make sure that the Raspberry Pi +5V power supply can handle the increased power requirements. For example, stacking 3x `DQ10rly` `I2C-HATs` would require a maximum of 3x300mA=900mA(when all relays are ON, see max. power consumption in `DQ10rly` [specs][dq10-relay-specs]) usualy this should be no problem for the standard Raspberry Pi +5V AC adapter which delivers 2.5A, but it depends on how much current the Rasperry Pi consumes.

Besides the I2C bus pins, some types of `I2C-HATs` use an additional GPIO to inform Raspberry Pi that something has happened(an `I2C-HAT` input changed state for example) and Raspberry Pi should issue the appropriate requests to detect what happened. The described mechanism is to avoid polling over I2C bus. On `DI16ac` and `DI6acDQ6rly` this signal is labeled `IRQ` and by default is routed to GPIO21 of the Raspberry Pi. The `IRQ` signal can be routed to other Raspberry Pi GPIOs using solder jumpers.

The `I2C-HAT` was designed for minimal Raspberry Pi GPIO usage, so that the user can stack other types of add-on boards from other manufactures.

The `I2C-HAT` connector has the full 40 pins.

The `I2C-HAT` has the same mechanical dimmensions as Raspberry Pi, it's length is greater than the standard HAT, it extends over the Raspberry Pi USB and Ethernet connectors. To install the `I2C-HAT` on Raspberry Pi you need [20mm plastic spacers/stnadoffs][mounting-kit].

## I2C baudrate and clock stretching

The recommended baudrate for the `I2C-HAT`s is 100kbps, this is the default Raspberry PI I2C baudrate.

During I2C bus communication it’s possible that the `I2C-HAT` will stretch the clock until it finishes processing the current request. Clock stretching appears more often during the firmware update process. Make sure that the I2C bus master supports clock stretching if you plan to connect the `I2C-HATs` to other platforms than Raspberry Pi.

**IMPORTANT:** The default clock stretching timeout value of the Raspberry Pi is too small. For more details on how to setup the clock stretching timeout value see the [I2C clock stretching timeout on the Raspberry Pi][i2c-clkst-post] post. If you install the [raspihats package][raspihats-package], the clock stretching timeout value will be set automatically by the package setup script as explained in the previously mentioned post.

## I2C Address

The `I2C-HAT` [address selector](#description) allows the user to select up to 16 different I2C bus addresses. The selector controls the lower nibble(4 bits) of the address, the X part of the address(see table below), the higher nibble is fixed, it’s value depends on the type of `I2C-HAT`(see table below). Theoretically up to 200x `I2C-HATs`(max. 16x of the same type) can be connected on the bus at the same time, provided you have the right power supply, the +5V rail should be able to supply the necessary current for your setup(Raspberry Pi and all `I2C-HATs`). You should check power consumption for all HATs you are planning to add to your setup.

## I2C-HAT Functionality

### Status LED

The [Status LED](#description) is located near pin 1 of the Raspberry Pi connector.
The Status LED has different blinking patterns used to indicate different states of the Communication Watchdog.

With the Communication Watchdog **disabled** the Status LED pattern is 75ms ON, 3s OFF.

When Communication Watchdog is **enabled** the Status LED patters are as follows:

| Blink Pattern                        | State                         |
|:-------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| 75ms ON, 3s OFF                      | RPi Communication timeout     |
| 75ms ON, 75 ms OFF, 75 ms ON, 3s OFF | RPi Communication is OK       |

### Communication Watchdog

The communication watchdog is used to detect a communication timeout, when a timeout occurs the Status LED pattern is changed and if the I2C-HAT has Digital Output Channels(Relays, Open Collectors, etc..) the Safety Value for the outputs is loaded.

Using I2C commands you can Get/Set the Communication Watchdog Period. The Period is stored in the on-board FLASH of the I2C-HAT.

### Digital Outputs

Using I2C commands you can Get/Set the Digital Output Channels states, all at once or by specific channel. There are two concepts linked to the Digital Output Channels:

  1. PowerOn Value – loaded at power on, after reset
  2. Safety Value – loaded at communication timeout

The PowerOn and Safety Values are stored in the on-board FLASH of the I2C-HAT, so they’re available at next board power-up. Get/Set commands are available for both values

### Digital Inputs

Using I2C commands you can Get the Digital Input Channels states, all at once or by specific channel. Every Digital Input Channel has two Counters attached that count rising and falling edges. There are I2C commands that can Get/Reset the edge counters.

## Firmware Update

Firmware update is possible via I2C bus, check the `I2C-HAT` [Firmware update][firmware-update-post] post for details.
